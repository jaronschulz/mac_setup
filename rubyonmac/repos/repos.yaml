# For each repo you want to clone from GitHub, specify the name of the GitHub
# repo and the path of the top-level folder where you want the repo to be cloned.
# For now, the repo name locally must match the name of the repo on GitHub, so
# don't include the repo name in the path.

# For the "name", include both the GitHub username or org name and the repo name,
# separated by a slash.
# For example:
# This will create a folder called Keyboard-Maestro-Macros in ~/code
# - path: ~/code
#   name: monfresh/Keyboard-Maestro-Macros

- path: ~/Projects/code/--learning/react-tdd
  name: jaronschulz/opinion-ate
