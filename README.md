To set up a new Mac:

1. Sign in to iCloud and App Store

1. Install all macOS updates.

2. Launch App Store and sign in, otherwise installing apps via [mas](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas) wonâ€™t work.

3. Install 1Password and sign in.

4. Quit Terminal (if it's running), and give it full disk access in System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy tab -> Full Disk Access

5. Download `.laptop.local`:
```shell
cd ~
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monfresh/dotfiles/master/dot_laptop.local
mv dot_laptop.local .laptop.local
```

6. Run the laptop script:
```shell
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monfresh/laptop/master/laptop)
```
When prompted by chezmoi for email, enter the email you want to use for Git.
When prompted for location, enter `home` or `work`, so that the appropriate apps
and aliases are installed based on whether this is a home computer or work computer.
See [Brewfile.local.tmpl](https://github.com/monfresh/dotfiles/blob/master/Brewfile.local.tmpl) for an example.
When prompted for the various tokens, get them from 1Password and paste them in.

7. Restart the computer.

8. Read `~/.laptop.manual.md` for additional manual setup instructions:
